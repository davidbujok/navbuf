## Features

- **Popup Window Navigation:** Invoke a popup window with a user-defined keybind to list marks.
Navigate to a desired mark by pressing a single letter.
- **Case Translation:** All Neovim capital marks are translated to lower case, eliminating the need
to press Shift + letter.
- **Buffer Mark Navigation:** Press the period key to switch to a buffer's lower-case mark when the
plugin is invoked.
- **Quick Navigation:** An optional keybind allows moving to a file marked with a capital MARK and
then immediately picking up the buffer's mark related to that file without pressing the period key.
This enables quick navigation with just three key presses.
- **Instant Mark List:** Provides an instant list of defined mappings, aiding users who are unsure
or forget the mappings set for a given buffer.

Experience quicker and more convenient file navigation with NavBuf!
